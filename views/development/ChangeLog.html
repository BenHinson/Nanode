  <h1>Change Log</h1>
  
  <h2>September 2020</h2>
    <h4>General</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Performance and Cleanup</u> - Server and Client Side cleanup and code reductions. Minified CSS/HTML/JS Files to improve load times. Multiple functions converted to asynchronous. Removal of unused classes and instances of identical ID/Class on elements.</li>
      <li><u>Startup</u> - Added 'General' span underneath Master Folders. This span <h5>cannot be renamed</h5>.</li>
      <li><u>Bug Fixed</u> - where the initial creation of the master folders would be run on each login, changing pointers to new empty folders. (didnt remove old ones from user-file)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Panels</h4>
    <span>Further work on the left-bar panels, including a standardized design and layout, with animated hot-switching between.</span>
    <div>Panels: <h6>Settings, Bin and Codex are almost fully complete.</h6></div>
    <ul>
      <li>Settings - Still to be Added: (Bin Count, Timezones, Locked Icons, Last Accessed, Starting Directory, Lock all Links) All others functional.</li>
      <li>Bin - Functional, can view deleted <h6>single</h6> files and either permanantly delete or retrieve them. Still no limit on size or items.</li>
      <li>Codex - Added audio player for uploaded audio files using a much simpler, efficient system than Alpharium via streams from file urls. Only volume left.</li>
      <li>Codex - Added Folders and Sub-directories to help sort and order files in the codex. Can view all sub-items in folders. Works using recursion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Development Portal</h4>
    <span>Development Portal Added, with pages currently being completed and a standardized layout finalized.</span>

    <h4>Drag and Drop</h4>
    <span>The movement of files and folders is being worked on, with most server-side systems in place and functional. This is being done using, <a href="//javatpoint.com/jquery-ui-sortable">jQueryUI Sortable</a> </span>
    <span>Current implementation is only on codex for moving files into and back out-of folders. (No folder movement or order change)</span>
    <span>No current mobile drag and drop at the moment, and it won't be looked into until after the desktop version is finalized and implemented.</span>


  <h2>August 2020</h2>
    <h4>Alpharium to Nanode</h4>
    <span>Conversion of Alpharium to Nanode, with new assets, new domain and new back-end file layout being completed. With this change comes the foundation for new features and additional support for existing features.</span>
    <span>A new 'PCB' styled section has been added to highlight basic features, as well as a coloured flow-chart and labelling to display how an action is carried out.</span>
    <span>This re-design also moves away from using pre-designed public SVG's and icons, towards custom ones for improve continuity and design style. Until all icons are changed, shout-out to <a href="//fontawesome.com">Font Awesome</a>, <a href="//icons8.com">Icons 8</a> and <a href="//material.io">Material IO</a> for usage of their icons.</span>

    <h4>Download</h4>
    <span>You can not download files and folders!</span>
    <span><code>Right-Click > Download</code> to add a file / folder to the download list one at a time or:</span>
    <span><code>With Details On, Left Click to Select an Item, Hold SHIFT, and click on other items to select multiple, then Right-Click > Download</code> This will add all files Selected to the download list.</span>
    <span>Click download to start the download of the files. <h3>Note: Duplicates of a file are not downloaded.</h3> These files will be downloaded as a Zip. To Un-Zip the file and retreive your items:</span> <code>Find the File Location, Right-Click > Extract Here. This creates folder: 'Download'. Open to view your downloaded items.</code>

    <h4>Additional Drive Pages - Panels</h4>

    <span>Pages: Contacts, Panels, Codex, Bin and Settings. Have been added, along with the selector to access them. These pages heavily link into the future of Nanode and what our goal is.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Contacts - <h5>Featuring Groups and Private Chats, Contacts will be a File Sharing and Basic Messaging Page for the communication between users.</h5></li>
      <li>Panels - <h5>A Grid of Large Blocks will act as major 'hubs' for related content. Websites, Videos, Folders, Lists, all with custom easy-to-see designs.</h5></li>
      <li>Codex - <h5>This Page features 3 main headlines: Notes - Videos - Music. This is a list-style file-system to write, view, listen and upload content of a specific type.</h5></li>
      <li>Bin - <h5>Didn't mean to delete that file? Visit the bin to view and retrieve your last 10 deleted files without a worry.</h5></li>
      <li>Settings - <h5>Make Nanode your own, change styles, colours, limits, security, backgrounds and more...</h5></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>July 2020</h2>
    <h4>Bin</h4>
    <span>Addition of back-end support for numerous systems, including a bin for deleted files. Full support for the bin, including its interface and functions will be added in August.
