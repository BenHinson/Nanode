    <h2>June 2021</h2>

    <h4>Homepage Folders</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><h5>Base Folders</h5> - The initial starting folders of 'Documents, Games, Media, Music and Notes', now have their own section and design to distinguish them.</li>
      <li><h5>Recent Files</h5> - A new API has been built to fetch, view and go to recently opened files. <h6 style="font-style: italic;">Folders could be added in the future.</h6> This is a local toggleable setting. <code>https://drive.nanode.one/activity/recent/main</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Preview</h4>
    <span>Simply click on a file to view it.</span>
    <ul>
      <li><h5>Font</h5> - Added a preview for fonts.</li>
      <li><h5>Audio</h5> - Added a preview for audio files.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Styling</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><h5>Modes</h5> - Darkmode, and soon Lightmode, will use global :root colours instead of SCSS defined variables. This will allow for other Colour Styles to be optional in the future, and possibly cleaner, smaller CSS files too.</li>
      <li><h5>Right-Bar</h5> - has been redesigned slightly to work in seperated segments.</li>
      <li><h5>File Move</h5> - has recieved a 'hover over wait' loading animation to help show how long you must hover over a folder and wait, to load into it. Set to 2.5 seconds.</li>
      <li><h5>Icons</h5> - a start on New File Icons has been done, with them soon to be added.</li>
      <li><h5>Empty Folders</h5> - opening an empty folder now shows an image to prompt the user how to upload / create new items.</li>
      <li><h5>Bin Usage</h5> - the bin page now features an updated Use-Breakdown and Use-Information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>JS Cleanup</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>New global API's handle traffic to the server, along with many other repetative code being converted to an seperate function.</li>
      <li>Area's of code have been coverted to Classes, including: 'ColorPicker, Popups, Security Input and Rightclick'</li>
      <li>Lots of code has been read through and reduced for legibility and optimisation.</li>
      <li>The RightClick handler has had some changes to improve the way of adding new options and new rightclick elements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Server</h4>
    <span>A new function to handle replies to the client. <code>Send.Message(Response, statusCode, Data)</code></span>
    <span>Cloudflare <h6 style="font-style: italic;">should</h6> now save static content to serve requests faster.</span>

  <section> <!-- MAY 2021 -->
    <h2>May 2021</h2>

    <h4>Upload Improvements</h4>
    <span>Further improved on upload.</span>
    <ul>
      <li><h5>Notifications</h5> - New notification popup for completed / successfull uploads, failed uploads and warnings.</li>
      <li><h5>Storage Checks</h5> - Unlimited storage is no more! Client side (and server side) now use the account plan as a limiter to warn and prevent excessive upload.</li>
      <li><h5>Queue Removal</h5> - Hover over an item in the upload queue and click to remove it. This updates against any storage limit warning to let you know when you are ready to go.</li>
      <li><h5>Pause / Continue</h5> - Finally added the ability to Pause... Wait... Continue! uploading files. This only works in the same session. Closing the page will forget where you were.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Settings</h4>
    <span>Cleaned out unused settings and updated the API to fetch them. <code>await API_Fetch({url: '/account/settings'})</code> Will request your settings from the server. View the <code>UserSettings</code> variable, in the console, to see your account and local settings.</span>

    <h4>Multiples</h4>
    <span>Updated the server API for 'edits' (which handles file moves, and Node data ie: name) to be able to process multiple items at once. Hold down <code>Shift</code> and click on files to select multiple, then drag and drop them to where you want!</span>

    <h4>A Whole New... Homepage</h4>
    <span>Updated and launched the Nanode homepage to the new design! This also includes full mobile support and some swanky animations.</span>

    <h4>Files</h4>
    <span>Client Side Styling in SCSS, JS and HTML have all been scowered and cleaned to reduce their size and make it easier to add new features. The layout of assets has also been changed slightly to differentiate between seperate areas.</span>
    <span>The client side wasn't the only receiver of this frenzy, the server also went through major changes to its file/folder layout and sizing.</span>

  <section> <!-- MARCH 2021 -->
    <h2>March 2021</h2>
    <!-- <span>Prep for Facebook</span> -->
    <h4>SocketIO Removal</h4>
    <span>SocketIO has been very useful, but it is now being phased out of Nanode as our current uses of it can be done without. Saving on initial load times by not needing to download the package and initiate a connection. SocketIO also caused issues with Nord Auth, due to SocketIO not being able to assign new cookies from the server reliably, meaning if a cookie runs out while using Nanode and the clients next request to the server is through SocketIO (ie: Calling an item's information) The server would update the database but the client wouldn't recieve the new session and log the client out on the next request. A loss of connction to the server would also require the client pressing a button to reconnect. Bad user experience.</span>
    <span>The Socket API's have been re-written and added to the drive subdomain. Including: '/share', '/edit', '/create'</span>

    <h4>Navigation</h4>
    <span>Navigation has been reworked to be more reliable. This includes new API handlers to accurately request and handle directory information.</span>

    <h4>Bin</h4>
    <span>API work and processing of the clients Bin Size has been added, with an initial loading animation.</span>

    <h4>Nova Search</h4>
    <span>The long awaited search functionality has been implemented, well... some of it. The start of it. Really just the bare bones. But its happening!</span>
    <span>Nova Search will allow for returning Nodes (folders and files) that meet certain parameters. Learn More at <a onclick="SwitchPage('nova', document.querySelector('#nova'))">Nova</a></span>

    <h4>Misc</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>More work has been done on the new homepage, content and styling.</li>
      <li>Visit <a href='https://speech.nanode.one/'>Nanode Speech</a> to see a currently useless page utilising the inbuilt speech API. Currently only works on Google Chrome. Maybe for Search???</li>
    </ul>

  <section> <!-- DECEMBER 2020 -->
    <h2>December 2020</h2>
    <h4>Server Rewrite. Introduction of Node - Nano - Space</h4>
    <span>To move inline with user-account storage, authentication and links, users file-data was migrated from JSON files to a MongoDB document, allowing for faster reads, better RAM usage and the ability to use their inbuild tools for queries and editing.</span>
    <span>This months updates, due to the change to MongoDB reworked ALL API calls, this will help massively for the implementation of new features.</span>
    <span>Altered the code referring to security checks to improve performance and reliability.</span>
    <span>Along with just changing the location of where user-data is stored, <h3>I am now referring to 'file meta-data' to a 'Node' and its corresponding file as a 'Nano'</h3></span>

    <h4>The structure of a users Space</h4>
    <span>The users Space is broken down into different 'sections', main/codex/blocks/bin. Nodes (The relating data to a file) can be moved across sections, but cannot reference a Node in another section. The users Space also stores; Recently accessed files, homepage views and a copy of the users storage the allocation.</span>
    <ul>
      <li><h5>Size</h5> - Total, bin, max. Stores the total allocated space, as well as what a breakdown of each file-types usage.</li>
      <li><h5>Recent</h5> - Not yet used, but saves and array of Node ID's for the most recently accessed folders / files in a set section.</li>
      <li><h5>home</h5> - The Nodes in which to read first when accessing a section. Main for example has an array of the users spans and their corresponding Node ID.</li>
      <li><h5>main</h5> - Main, Codex, Blocks and Bin all have their own tree, to distinguish for searching. These sections store the Nodes within.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>A Node</h4>
    <span>The node is the meta-data referring to an item, (file, folder, block, ...).</span>
    <span>The Node points to other Nodes, eg: Parent, Files within (if folder), Nano (if file) and its owner.</span>
    <img src="/assets/dev/changelog/dec20/node.png" alt="Node Code (carbon)">

    <h4>Folder Contents</h4>
    <span>If the Node is a folder that contains a file, contents will contain the following 'Short-Node'. Storing a Short-Node, allows for only one request for MongoDB to handle, being to return the Node relating to the folder's ID. The information within a 'Short-Node' is enough to provide the user-interface.</span>
    <img src="/assets/dev/changelog/dec20/short_node.png" alt="Short-Node Code (carbon)">



    <h4>Small Tweeks</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Finishing touches to the upload system in November, removing any bugs noticed.</li>
      <li>A handful of design changes</li>
      <li>Improved mobile view</li>
      <li>Image, video and Text API updates to move away from SocketIO, as well as loading icons.</li>
      <li>Removal or rewrite of legacy and rushed code, renaming of various variables and functions.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section> <!-- NOVEMBER 2020 -->
    <h2>November 2020</h2>
    <h4>Nord</h4>
    <span>Account authentication API has been developed, using a custom version of the JWT protocol. Nord grants 20 minute access to an account before checking with the database that the token has not been tampered, account access is still granted and the device is still the same.</span>

    <h4>Moving away from <a href="https://socket.io/">SocketIO</a></h4>
    <span>SocketIO has drastically made the development of Nanode easier, though to move inline with industry standards, web-sockets are being replaced by standard fetch/push to urls.</span>
    <span>Folder call, Item information and actions are being migrated.</span>
    <span>Due to SocketIO still being in use, a try/reconnect button has been added to assist users if the socket dies.</span>

    <h4>Yet another design overhall.</h4>
    <span>Continuing on from october, designs of main features and the layout have been changed in the quest to find the perfect colours, minimalism and fonts.</span>

    <h4>Upload Overhall</h4>
    <span>In line with moving away from SocketIO. Upload has been reworked.</span>
    <span>Simply replacing the API was not enough, as limitations of sizes started to play a part. Limiting at 5MB.</span>
    <span>Although the 5MB could be increased, now sitting at 50MB per call, the idea of uploading large files revealed more issues.</span>
    <span>To combat broken connections, and to provide users with information about their upload, I settled on chunking files into 2MB pieces, uploading a piece, logging it to the user, and writing the chunk. The server then responds the status, successfull, or not and requests the next chunk. The time between send and recieve is logged and allows the client-end to estimate the upload time, as well as percentage. Once all chunks are uploaded, the completed file is moved into the mass storage, the files metadata is created and the next file is requested.</span>
  </section>

  <section> <!-- OCTOBER 2020 -->
    <h2>October 2020</h2>
    <span>Item information total rework, moving to a new API: drive.nanode.one/user / x / x / x and opening side-bar</span>
    <span>More precise logging of activity times when an item is uploaded or accessed.</span>
    <span>Server change of the returned clipped image, accepting null. <code>storage/ <i>objectID</i> ?h=128&w=null</code></span>
    <span>More helpful functions to the client side: RGBtoHEX / Date&Time converter / capFirstLetter / ItemImage / ItemChecker</span>
    <span>Rework and condense of the file display system. No longer two different functions for homepage and non homepage.</span>
    <span>Download Rework 2, improving and reducing code. No longer calls user-file</span>
    <span>Easier methods to read and write account information on the server, reducing development time for account information related features.</span>
    <span>Generating a share link has been developed alongside Item Information, storing the URL, owner, nanoID, fileName and mimetype</span>

    <h4>Directory Path Rework</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Rework to the directory path system with a new design and features.</li>
      <li>Added Forward / Backward / Home and Navigation buttons</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Drag and Drop</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Drag Files and Folders into and out of directories, between spans.</li>
      <li>Navigate into folders by holding another item over it for 2 seconds. <h6>List View Only</h6></li>
      <li>Drag and drop only activates for files & folders, no longer causing an upload error on text selection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Mobile</h4>
    <span>Rework of the mobile navigatio bar to allow access to the left bar.</span>

  <section> <!-- SEPTEMBER 2020 -->
    <h2>September 2020</h2>
      <h4>General</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Performance and Cleanup</u> - Server and Client Side cleanup and code reductions. Minified CSS/HTML/JS Files to improve load times. Multiple functions converted to asynchronous. Removal of unused classes and instances of identical ID/Class on elements.</li>
        <li><u>Startup</u> - Added 'General' span underneath Master Folders. This span <h6>cannot be renamed</h6>.</li>
        <li><u>Bug Fixed</u> - where the initial creation of the master folders would be run on each login, changing pointers to new empty folders. (didnt remove old ones from user-file)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Panels</h4>
      <span>Further work on the left-bar panels, including a standardized design and layout, with animated hot-switching between.</span>
      <div>Panels: <h6>Settings, Bin and Codex are almost fully complete.</h6></div>
      <ul>
        <li>Settings - Still to be Added: (Bin Count, Timezones, Locked Icons, Last Accessed, Starting Directory, Lock all Links) All others functional.</li>
        <li>Bin - Functional, can view deleted <h6>single</h6> files and either permanantly delete or retrieve them. Still no limit on size or items.</li>
        <li>Codex - Added audio player for uploaded audio files using a much simpler, efficient system than Alpharium via streams from file urls. Only volume left.</li>
        <li>Codex - Added Folders and Sub-directories to help sort and order files in the codex. Can view all sub-items in folders. Works using recursion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Development Portal</h4>
      <span>Development Portal Added, with pages currently being completed and a standardized layout finalized.</span>

      <h4>Drag and Drop</h4>
      <span>The movement of files and folders is being worked on, with most server-side systems in place and functional. This is being done using, <a href="//javatpoint.com/jquery-ui-sortable">jQueryUI Sortable</a> </span>
      <span>Current implementation is only on codex for moving files into and back out-of folders. (No folder movement or order change)</span>
      <span>No current mobile drag and drop at the moment, and it won't be looked into until after the desktop version is finalized and implemented.</span>
