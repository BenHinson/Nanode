// ========================

// Socket IO Removal - Why? Although very useful.
//    Have to load code and Connect everytime.
//    A loss of connection requires manually reconnecting.
//    If a socket request is the first event after a cookie has ran out, you cant set the new cookie on the server.

// Fix of Navigation

  // File Move for Block.

  // The Multiple Update:
      // Selection Box - Shows Selection Data at the bottom. Narrow Bar like VSCode blue bar.
      // Multi-Move

  // The Right-Click Update:
      // Security. Including removal.
      // Copy To
      // Move To
      // Create Shortcut
      // Share

  // Settings Review, JS, Functions and Page Revision.

  // Icons for Different File types.

  // Search Implementation - Remember to check the previous names settings too for items.

Drag Files and Folders into and out of directories, between Spans, and navigate through directories by hovering over folders. (List Only atm)
Complete Rework of the Directory Path System, Adding Forward / Backward / Home / Path Buttons, with multiple layers so you can get back to where you were.
Long hold over a folder opens it. So you can move files deep into folders in one go.
Item information TOTAL rework. Server api support to return file object. -> drive.nanode.one/user/ x / x / x eg: codex/text/home
Mobile Rework of navigation bar. Can now access left bar.
Server change of time-saving. now full string. And logging more times.
Server change of return clipped image. now accepts null.   storage/ ObjectID ?h=128&w=null. Will scale to fit.
Now using nodemon on the server to help with restarts. bless nodemon.
New helpfully functions on client: RGBtoHEX && Date/Time Converter.
Calling file Information is now consistent with the sidebar. (opens side-bar is called).
Rework and condense of the file display system. No longer two different functions for homepage and non homepage.
New global functions: capFirstLetter (capatalize first letter), ItemImage. and Refining of ItemChecker (The Items Type).
Dragging and Dropping Non-Files while over the client doest run the upload code that subsequently errors as its not a file.
Along With File Information Rework, download has been reworked, improved, and code shortened. Also No longer calling user file for each item.
Generating a link for items has been developed, with each link looking like so in the database:
   {"_id": {"url": `the url path pointer. 16 character nanoid.`}, {"owner:" `uuid`}, {"object": `object id in users database`}, {"file": `name of item`}, {"mime": `mime-type of item`}}
Easier Method on server end to read and write account information, reducing development time for account info related features.
