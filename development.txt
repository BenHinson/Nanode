Along With File Information Rework, download has been reworked, improved, and code shortened. Also No longer calling user file for each item.
Generating a link for items has been developed, with each link looking like so in the database:
   {"_id": {"url": `the url path pointer. 16 character nanoid.`}, {"owner:" `uuid`}, {"object": `object id in users database`}, {"file": `name of item`}, {"mime": `mime-type of item`}}
Easier Method on server end to read and write account information, reducing development time for account info related features.
