  <h1>Change Log</h1>
  
  <h2>September 2020</h2>
    <h4>Development Portal</h4>
    <span>Development Portal Added, with pages currently being completed and a standardized layout finalized.</span>
    <h4>Drag and Drop</h4>
    <span>Moving Files around is in early development, and stands as a purely cosmetic, temporary layout until a refresh. Continued development of this is planned, as well as it to work for both List and Block views of the file system. Mobile integration is being looked into. This is being done using, <a href="//javatpoint.com/jquery-ui-sortable">jQueryUI Sortable</a> currently.</span>

  <h2>August 2020</h2>
    <h4>Alpharium to Nanode</h4>
    <span>Conversion of Alpharium to Nanode, with new assets, new domain and new back-end file layout being completed. With this change comes the foundation for new features and additional support for existing features.</span>
    <span>A new 'PCB' styled section has been added to highlight basic features, as well as a coloured flow-chart and labelling to display how an action is carried out.</span>
    <span>This re-design also moves away from using pre-designed public SVG's and icons, towards custom ones for improve continuity and design style. Until all icons are changed, shout-out to <a href="//fontawesome.com">Font Awesome</a>, <a href="//icons8.com">Icons 8</a> and <a href="//material.io">Material IO</a> for usage of their icons.</span>

    <h4>Download</h4>
    <span>You can not download files and folders!</span>
    <span><code>Right-Click > Download</code> to add a file / folder to the download list one at a time or:</span>
    <span><code>With Details On, Left Click to Select an Item, Hold SHIFT, and click on other items to select multiple, then Right-Click > Download</code> This will add all files Selected to the download list.</span>
    <span>Click download to start the download of the files. <h3>Note: Duplicates of a file are not downloaded.</h3> These files will be downloaded as a Zip. To Un-Zip the file and retreive your items:</span> <code>Find the File Location, Right-Click > Extract Here. This creates folder: 'Download'. Open to view your downloaded items.</code>
    <span>To read more about how the Download process works, Explore <h5>Development Portal > Calls > Read > Downloads</h5></span>

    <h4>Additional Drive Pages</h4>
    <span>This update added the addition of differing Pages. <h3>Note: Being a Major Features, these pages are undergoing development at different stages.</h3></span>
    <span>Pages: Contacts, Panels, Codex, Bin and Settings. Have been added, along with the selector to access them. These pages heavily link into the future of Nanode and what our goal is.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Contacts - <h5>Featuring Groups and Private Chats, Contacts will be a File Sharing and Basic Messaging Page for the communication between users.</h5></li>
      <li>Panels - <h5>A Grid of Large Blocks will act as major 'hubs' for related content. Websites, Videos, Folders, Lists, all with custom easy-to-see designs.</h5></li>
      <li>Codex - <h5>This Page features 3 main headlines: Notes - Videos - Music. This is a list-style file-system to write, view, listen and upload content of a specific type.</h5></li>
      <li>Bin - <h5>Didn't mean to delete that file? Visit the bin to view and retrieve your last 10 deleted files without a worry.</h5></li>
      <li>Settings - <h5>Make Nanode your own, change styles, colours, limits, security, backgrounds and more...</h5></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>July 2020</h2>
    <h4>Bin</h4>
    <span>Addition of back-end support for numerous systems, including a bin for deleted files. Full support for the bin, including its interface and functions will be added in August. The bin addition and general clean-up of the read / write code has allowed for faster, more secure and less buggy general systems.</span>

    <h3>Logs Before This Point are to be Added Later</h3>
